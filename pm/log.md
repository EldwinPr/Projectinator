# Workflow Log

Narrative record of what happened and why. **Newest entry at the top.**
Append-only: never edit or delete a past entry — a log that gets corrected in
place is a log nobody can trust as evidence. A superseded entry is corrected by
a new entry that says so.

## What goes here, and what does not

This file records **events**. `context/` records **truth**. The test: if the
sentence would still be worth reading when the issue is long closed, it belongs
in `context/`, not here.

| | Goes to |
|---|---|
| "FIX-12 closed, verified against the failing case" | here |
| "The gateway style attribute is `gwType=`, not `symbol=`" | `context/` — via `context/gotchas.md` |
| "We chose X over Y, and here is what it costs" | `context/index/decisions/` + a row in `decisions.md` |
| "What is open, what is next" | `pm/tracker.yaml` |

A durable fact that lands only here is lost: nothing reads this file at session
start, by design.

## Entry format

One `-` bullet per event, newest first:

```markdown
- **YYYY-MM-DD** `[TAG][ID]` **Headline in bold.** What changed, what it was
  verified against, and anything a future reader would otherwise have to
  reconstruct. Inline `[TAG]`s are fine mid-entry when one event carried
  several kinds of outcome.
```

`ID` is the issue id, or omitted for work that never became an issue.

| Tag | For |
|---|---|
| `[STATUS]` | An issue opened, moved, closed, or was dropped |
| `[DECISION]` | A choice was made — record the alternative that was rejected |
| `[DISCOVERY]` | Something turned out not to be what it looked like |
| `[TODO]` | Something was deliberately deferred, and what would settle it |
